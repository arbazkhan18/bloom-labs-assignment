**  I've made this template using html css bootstrap jquery ive downloaded the files and not used CDN 

** Since I've not used Angular I cannot do much but I've tried and done this within short period of time if given more time I would make it more beautiful and 
add more functionalities.

** I've added the form validation functionality at the bottom of the page and included js file but commented it out.

** Since I am an Angular developer I've implemented contact (form) logic already please check this link out.
